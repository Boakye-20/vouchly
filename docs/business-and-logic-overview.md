## Vouch Score System - Detailed Business Logic

### Starting Score
- **All users start with 80 points** (fair baseline)
- **Range: 0-100** (enforced by system)
- **Precision:** Scores are stored as integers, rounded to nearest whole number

### Score Changes by Event Type

| Event Type | Score Change | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `COMPLETION_CONFIRMED` | +2 | Both users confirm session completion |
| `UNILATERAL_NO_SHOW` | -10 | One user doesn't show up |
| `MUTUAL_NO_SHOW` | -5 | Neither user attends |
| `CONSECUTIVE_RESCHEDULE` | -5 | Second consecutive reschedule |
| `CANCELLED_LOCKED_IN` | -10 | Cancelled within 4 hours of start |
| `CANCELLED_WITH_NOTICE` | 0 | Cancelled with proper notice (no penalty) |
| `RESCHEDULED_WITH_NOTICE` | 0 | First reschedule (no penalty) |
| `START_CONFIRMED` | 0 | Session started (no points) |
| `ADJUSTMENT` | Â±X | Manual adjustment by admin |

### Rescheduling Logic
- **First reschedule:** No penalty (0 points)
- **Second consecutive reschedule:** -5 points
- **Consecutive reschedule counter resets** when:
  - A session is completed successfully
  - A penalty is applied (after second consecutive reschedule)
  - 30 days pass without any reschedules
- **Non-consecutive reschedules:** No penalty (even if you reschedule multiple times, as long as you complete sessions between them)

### Cancellation Logic
- **Cancelled with notice (>4 hours before):** No penalty (0 points)
- **Cancelled within 4 hours:** -10 points (treated as no-show)
- **Undo window:** 5 minutes to undo cancellation
- **Multiple cancellations:** Each cancellation is treated independently

### Session Completion Logic
- **Both users must confirm completion** for +2 points
- **If only one confirms:** No points awarded
- **Session must be started** (both users confirmed start) before completion points can be earned
- **Completion window:** Users have 24 hours after session end to confirm completion

### Vouch Score History
- **Every score change is logged** with:
  - Event type and reason
  - Score before and after
  - Session ID and timestamp
  - Admin notes (for manual adjustments)
  - IP address and user agent for audit purposes
  - Related transaction ID (if applicable)

### Special Cases
- **New users (first 3 sessions):** Reduced penalties for first-time offenses
- **Consistent performers:** Users with >90% session completion rate get benefit of doubt for first late cancellation
- **Repeat offenders:** Users with multiple infractions may face additional penalties at admin's discretion

## Session State Machine

### Core States
1. **`requested`** - Initial state when session is created
   - Can transition to: `scheduled`, `cancelled`
   - Timeout: 24 hours before auto-cancellation

2. **`scheduled`** - Both users have accepted
   - Can transition to: `in_progress`, `cancelled`
   - Locks 4 hours before start time
   - Sends reminder notifications at 24h and 1h before start

3. **`in_progress`** - Session is active
   - Can transition to: `completed`, `cancelled`
   - Both users must confirm start
   - Auto-completes after 6 hours if no action

4. **`completed`** - Session successfully finished
   - Final state
   - Triggers Vouch Score updates
   - Generates session summary

5. **`cancelled`** - Session was cancelled
   - Can be undone within 5 minutes
   - Triggers notifications to both users
   - May affect Vouch Score based on timing

### State Transitions
- All transitions are validated server-side
- Invalid transitions are rejected with detailed error messages
- Each transition is logged for audit purposes
- Some transitions trigger automatic notifications

### Data Model
```typescript
interface Session {
  id: string;
  participantIds: string[];
  scheduledStartTime: Timestamp;
  scheduledEndTime: Timestamp;
  status: 'requested' | 'scheduled' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'cancelled';
  startConfirmedBy: Record<string, boolean>;
  completionConfirmedBy: Record<string, boolean>;
  vouchScoreImpact?: {
    userId: string;
    change: number;
    reason: string;
  }[];
  metadata: {
    createdAt: Timestamp;
    updatedAt: Timestamp;
    cancelledAt?: Timestamp;
    completedAt?: Timestamp;
    cancelledBy?: string;
    cancellationReason?: string;
  };
}
```

## Session Management - Detailed Business Rules

### Session States
1. **`requested`** - Initial state when session is created
2. **`scheduled`** - Both users have accepted
3. **`in_progress`** - Both users have confirmed start
4. **`completed`** - Both users have confirmed completion
5. **`cancelled`** - Session was cancelled
6. **`pending_cancellation`** - Cancellation initiated, undo window active

### Session Confirmation Flow
1. **Start Confirmation:** Both users must confirm session start within 15 minutes
2. **Completion Confirmation:** Both users must confirm session completion
3. **If either user doesn't confirm:** No Vouch Score points awarded

### Booking Conflict Prevention
- **System checks for overlapping sessions** when scheduling
- **15-minute buffer** between sessions
- **Prevents double-booking** for both initiator and recipient

### 4-Hour Lock Rule
- **Sessions lock 4 hours before start time**
- **No rescheduling or cancellation** after lock-in
- **Penalty for late cancellation:** -10 points (treated as no-show)

### Undo System
- **5-minute window** to undo cancellation
- **Automatic finalization** after expiry
- **AI-managed cleanup** of expired undo actions

## Matching Algorithm - Detailed Breakdown

### Total Match Score Calculation (0-100)

| Component | Weight | Calculation Logic |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Schedule Overlap** | 40% | `min(shared_slots * 8, 40)` where shared_slots = identical availability slots |
| **Vouch Score Similarity** | 30% | `â¤5 diff â 30`, `â¤10 diff â 20`, `â¤20 diff â 10`, `>20 diff â 0` |
| **Subject Compatibility** | 15% | Exact match â 15, same subject group â 10, otherwise 0 |
| **Study Atmosphere** | 10% | Same preference â 10, different â 0 |
| **University Bonus** | 5% | Same university â 5, different â 0 |

### Advanced Matching Logic

#### Schedule Overlap
- Considers both weekly availability and one-time availability blocks
- Accounts for timezone differences automatically
- Respects user's "do not disturb" hours
- Minimum session length: 30 minutes
- Maximum session length: 4 hours

#### Vouch Score Similarity
- Uses a sliding scale for better granularity
- Special handling for new users (< 5 sessions)
- Considers rate of change (users with rapidly improving scores get slight boost)

#### Subject Compatibility
- Subject groups are defined in `lib/constants.ts`
- Cross-discipline matches are possible but weighted lower
- Users can specify multiple subjects of interest

### Match Tiers
- **Gold Compatibility (80-100 points)**
  - Excellent match across all dimensions
  - High likelihood of successful sessions
  - Prioritized in search results
  
- **Silver Compatibility (60-79 points)**
  - Good overall match
  - May have minor differences in preferences
  - Shown by default in search
  
- **Bronze Compatibility (40-59 points)**
  - Partial match
  - May have significant differences in key areas
  - Shown when "Show all matches" is enabled
  
- **Low Match (<40 points)**
  - Poor compatibility
  - Hidden by default
  - Can be shown with "Show all matches"

### Filtering & Sorting

#### Primary Sort
1. **Relevance Score** (descending)
   - Match score (80%)
   - Online status (10%)
   - Response rate (10%)

#### Secondary Filters
- **Availability**

  - Response rate
  - Session completion rate

#### Real-time Updates
- Scores update automatically when:
  - User updates availability
  - New sessions are completed
  - Vouch Scores change
